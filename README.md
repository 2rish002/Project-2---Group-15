# Welcome To Our Air Quality Analysis Project!

**Creators**: Ananya Goel (Project Lead), Rishi Raghavan, Aidan Wiktorowicz

**Project Summary**: This project provides an analysis of time-series data for air quality levels in the city of St. Louis, Missouri.

## Repository Contents
This repository is the library for all code files, figures, and media related to our project. We encourage you to explore and learn more about our project!
You'll find the following: 

1) **SCRIPTS Folder**: All source code for the project can be found here. Located here is a master script file which compiles all script files into a single executable file that produces our project's results.  
2) **DATA Folder**: The original Yelp dataset is included, along with a graphic briefly summarizing the data.
3) **OUPUT Folder**: This folder contains all project outputs, including figures from our project presentation.   
4) **License.md**: Guidelines for citation of our repository.

## Software and Platform
Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSC) was the primary software through which our project was coded. We used the Python coding language, and the ARIMA package in Python was an add-on installed to perform prediction analysis. Microsoft VSC was run on both Windows and MacOS software, aiding in versatility and accessibility of our project. 

## Documentation Map
**DATA**:
- Data For Project (.xlsx)
- Heating_Cooling_Degree_Days (.xlsx)
- TRFVOLUSM227NFWA (.csv)
- Raw Data Folder: Contains all raw source files which were averaged to create the "Data For Project" excel sheet

**SCRIPTS**:
- ARIMA Test (.ipynb)
- DS_project2 (.ipynb)

**OUTUT**: 
- Powerpoint Slides (Predicting St. Louis AQI)
- Average AQI graph
- Average Total Monthly Vehicles Traveled Graph

## Instructions for Reproducing Results
Please download the dataset and ensure it is saved with the default downloaded name. Then, download and run the DS_project2 script to produce the time series analysis graphs. You may run the ARIMA Test script to get the forcasted AQI results.
