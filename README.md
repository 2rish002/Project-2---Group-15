## Repository Contents
This repository is the library for all code files, figures, and media related to our project. We encourage you to explore and learn more about our project!
You'll find the following: 

1) **SCRIPTS Folder**: All source code for the project can be found here. Located here is a master script file which compiles all script files into a single executable file that produces our project's results.  
2) **DATA Folder**: The original Yelp dataset is included, along with a graphic briefly summarizing the data.
3) **OUPUT Folder**: This folder contains all project outputs, including figures from our project presentation.   
4) **License.md**: Guidelines for citation of our repository.

## Software and Platform
Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSC) was the primary software through which our project was coded. We used the Python coding language, and the VADER package in Python was an add-on installed to perform sentiment analysis. Microsoft VSC was run on both Windows and MacOS software, aiding in versatility and accessibility of our project.
